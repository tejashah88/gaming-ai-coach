## Notes for myself
- Config validation is mostly non-existent, and requires decent Python experience to understand the codebase. Comments within example configuation files should suffice but are not exhaustive.
- Only OpenAI's GPT-4o model has been tested, unsure about how nicely other model providers play with this program
- Code documentation is sparse at best, needs more comments for explaining function inputs/outputs and complex parts of code.
